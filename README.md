# Dimer_HVM

Simulations of light scattering off colloidal dimers for holographic characterization using the effective sphere interpretation.

Here we examine the effect of axial angle on effective size and refractive index, and compare with experimental data to draw insights about the rotational dynamics of dimers in a microfluidic channel.
